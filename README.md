# Virtual-Makeup
Finding facial landmark point in real-time as a guidance for Virtual Makeup ( Mirror Make up). Research still in progress.
Main objective of this research is to explore facial landamrk points in real-time and to locate midpoints on cheecks for blusher, shape of eyebrows, midpoints on eyelid for eyeshadow and finally lips.

p/s : You may need a file called "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" in order to run this python file otherwise, it does not work. You can find it online because i could not upload it (it is more than >50mb).
